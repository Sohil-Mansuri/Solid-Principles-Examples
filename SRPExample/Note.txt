As you can see here, the `Employee` class has 3 methods: 

- `CalculatePay`
- `Save`
- `ReportHours`

The `Employee` class is handled by 3 different people: the CFO, CTO, and COO, which violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Additionally, the `Save` method is performing two tasks: 
1. Saving the employee information into the database.
2. Logging information. 

If tomorrow the logging functionality changes, we would also have to modify the `Employee` class. This means the class has multiple reasons to change, 
which further violates SRP.

Solution:

To follow SRP, our project should aim for loose coupling and high cohesion. 

Each class should have one responsibility, and changes in one area should not impact unrelated parts of the system.
