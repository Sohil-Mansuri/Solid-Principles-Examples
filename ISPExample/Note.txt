First check Abstraction Section, How we Abstracted our previous code 

New Requirement:

1. In addition to salary, provide stock options to C-level employees.

Task:

- Create a new employee type.
- Create a method to calculate stock options.

 Problem:

If you look at the problem section, we added `CalculateStock` to the `IEmployeeFinance` interface. 

While it works fine for C-level employees, Full-time and Part-time employees don't need stock options, 
which violates the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP).

Solution:

Create a separate interface for handling stock options to ensure that only relevant classes implement it, adhering to ISP.
